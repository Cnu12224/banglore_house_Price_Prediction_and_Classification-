#  Bangalore House Price Prediction & Classification

This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using regression models and classifies properties based on value thresholds. It demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation pipelines.

## Features

- **Regression**: Predicts house prices using models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- **Classification**: Categorizes house listings into buckets (e.g., low, mid, high value).
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis.
- Model performance evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, MAPE

##  Dataset

Real estate data with features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathroom count, and location.

##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
